#+AUTHOR: Javier Pacheco
#+DESCRIPTION: Custom Emacs config.
#+STARTUP: showeverything
#+OPTIONS: toc:2

* FIXME: Actual status.

Noobemacs is now in maintenance, so it may or not work, so, for now I recommend to *no use this config*.

* Noob emacs.
This emacs configuration is intended to make it easy to use and configure when starting emacs. It has some "useful" packages, in addition to having a personal configuration file for the user to modify to their liking.

** Package manager: /elpaca/.
This config uses /elpaca/ as the package manager. 
- Why? 
Because why not.

** Install.
#+begin_src example
